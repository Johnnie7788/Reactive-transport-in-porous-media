# Reactive Transport in Porous Media

This repository explores the computational modeling of subsurface flow and transport processes relevant to energy storage and environmental systems.  
It focuses on the coupled behavior of fluids, gases, and reactive species moving through porous and fractured geological formations.

The Python scripts in this collection combine numerical simulation, thermodynamic computation, and data-driven analysis to study:

- Two-phase flow dynamics of gas–liquid systems in porous rocks  
- Reactive transport mechanisms influencing subsurface storage efficiency  
- The role of fractures, heterogeneity, and fluid properties on flow behavior  
- Integration of machine learning techniques with traditional physical models  

These tools are designed for research and educational purposes in fluid mechanics, hydrology, and reservoir engineering.  
They can serve as starting points for numerical experiments, data-driven model development, or performance assessment of underground hydrogen and gas storage systems.
